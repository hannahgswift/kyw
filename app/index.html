motherfucker, now look who's in trouble\nAs you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles\nKanye West samples, here's one for example\n\n\nGossip gossip, nigga just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\n\nProfit profit, nigga I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hand\n\nOh, the best living or dead hands down, huh?\nLess talk more head right now, huh?\nAnd my eyes more red than the devil is\nAnd I'm bout to take it to another level bitch\nMatter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this\nDo the rap and the track, triple double no assist\nAnd my only focus is staying on some bogus shit\nArgue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit\nI heard that people sing raps to give the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFuckin up my money so, yeh, I had to act sane\nChi nigga but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said, \"This the number to dial\nIf you wanna make your number one your number two now\nThis that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah\"\nGoddamn, Yeezy, how he hit em with the new style\nThrow that motherfucker, \"Well, whatchu gon' do now?\nWhatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now\"\nKnow I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now\nThink you motherfuckers really really need to cool out\n'Cause you will never get on top of this\nSo mommy best advice is just to get on top of this\nHave you ever had sex with a pharaoh?\nI put the pussy in a sarcophagus\nNow she claiming that I bruise her esophagus\nHead of the class and she just want a swallowship\nI'm living the future so the present is my past\nMy presence is a present, kiss my ass\n\n\nGossip gossip, nigga just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\n\nProfit profit, nigga I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hand\n\n\nSasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Lochness\nGoblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience\nQuestion, what do these things all have in common?\nEverybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster\nConquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense\nNonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is\nNone of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen\nI still hear fiends scream in my dreams\nMurder murder in black convertibles, I\nKill the block I murder the avenues, I\nRape and pillage a village, women and children\nEverybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is?\nLove, I don't get enough of it\nAll I get is these vampires and blood suckers\nAll I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires\nMilling about, spilling there feelings in the air\nAll I see is these fake fucks with no fangs\nTryna draw blood from my ice cold veins\nI smell a massacre\nSeems to be the only way to back you bastards up\n\n\nGossip gossip, nigga just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\n\nProfit profit, nigga I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfucking monster\nI'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert\nI'mma need to see your fucking hand\n\n\nPull up in a monster automobile, gangsta\nWith a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka\nYeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka\nYou could be the king but watch the queen conquer\nFirst things first I'll eat your brains\nThen I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs\n'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do\nHairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do\nMonster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe\nYoung Money is the roster and a monster crew\nAnd I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face\nAnd if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't\nSo let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?\nBut my features and my shows ten times your pay?\n50k for a verse, no album out\nYeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it\nHotter than a middle eastern climate, find it\nTony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it\nNicki on them titties, when I sign it\nThat's how these niggas so one-track minded\nBut really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K\nForget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake\nShe's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake\nAnd I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play\nJust killed another career, it's a mild day\nBesides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me\nI think me, you and Am should m\u00e9nage Friday\nPink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash\nI think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast\nNow look at what you just saw, this is what you live for\nAaaaahhh, I'm a motherfucking monster\n\n\nI, I crossed the line, line\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, cide\nI, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home\n\nI, I crossed the line, line\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, cide\nI, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home\n\nI, I crossed the line, line\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, cide\nI, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home";
